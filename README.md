This project analyzes a medical dataset containing anonymous patient records, specifically relevant to heart disease.
The project aims to demonstrate skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and classifier training (K Nearest Neighbors).

The project outline and dataset are part of a guided project on Dataquest.  The implementation and observations are my own work.
